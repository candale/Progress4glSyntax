This plugin creates a forward stack trace tree of the current file having as entry point the Main Block. 
To install the plugin, copy the file ForwardStackTrace.py to "C:\Users\$user\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User". If this path does not correspond to the one on your system, go to Tools -> New Plugin and paste the content of the file ForwardStackStrace.py into the newly created window and then save it into the default location.
In order to make use of this functionality go to Preferences -> Key Bindings - User and add this line to the file that will open: { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+t"], "command": "tree" }. You can change the keyboard shortcut to whatever you like.
